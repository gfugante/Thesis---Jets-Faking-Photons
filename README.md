# Thesis Jets Faking Photons Background Estimation
Scripts and documents from my bachelor degree thesis work at University of Studies of Milan (2019)

The main work is in 'Main Folder' and 'Main Folder | New Signal Regions'

Inside this folder you can find all data, documents and scripts used to evaluate the Jets Faking Photons background for the Monophoton analysis of the ATLAS 
experiment at CERN.
